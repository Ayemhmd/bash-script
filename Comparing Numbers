Given two integers, x and y , identify whether x<y or x>y  or x=y .
*******************************************
#!/bin/bash
read -p "Enter the value of X: " x
read -p "Enter the value of Y: " y

# Calculate the difference between X and Y
result=$((x - y))

# Check the result and print the comparison
if [ $result -gt 0 ]; then
  echo "X is greater than Y"
elif [ $result -lt 0 ]; then
  echo "X is less than Y"
else
  echo "X is equal to Y"
